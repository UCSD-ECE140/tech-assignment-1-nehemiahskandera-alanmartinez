Challenge 1:
For challenge 1 our files are the client1_publisher.py, client2_publisher.py, and subscriber_client. The client publishers have to be ran in their own terminals so they can send data, then our subscriber client is ran to receive and display the random data being sent.

Challenge 2: 
Our challenge 2 is all in playerclient.py, gameclient.py is ran first to start the game, then playerclient is ran and asks for user input for player movemnt.

Challenge 3:
The client for this challenge is on autoplayerclient.py. This script creates two teams of two players, then it creates random moves for each players until all the coins on the field are collected.
